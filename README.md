# DISSIDIA 012 package extractor

An all in one tool for file name hashing, decompiling files, and recompiling them for Dissidia 012 for the PSP. Tested on version ULUS10566. File list included is not finished but the tool can help you find what you are looking for. Should work on other copies of Dissidia as well but you'll need to create a new files list from scratch.

## What is this?

A single tool for all your Dissidia file mod needs. Not more guessing file names, this tool with hash file names for you and find any matching files in the PACKAGE_INFO index.

## How does it work?

First put your PACKAGE.BIN and PACKAGE_INFO.BIN files in the game directory as the exe.
